@article{Lyons2001,
abstract = {Though fundamental and technical analysis are still widely used in foreign exchange markets, a new type of analysis has emerged: or- der-flow analysis. Order-flow analysis uses the flow of buy and sell orders to both explain exchange rates contemporaneously and fore- cast future movements. This article contrasts order-flow analysis with the traditional approaches and reviews lessons learned. Most important among those lessons is order flow's ability to account for the lion's share of movements in the major floating rates. On the policy front, widespread availability of electronic order-flow data brings many policy questions within our reach for the first time. Af- ter reviewing these policy questions, the article closes with a dis- cussion of how FX market institutions are evolving and how this evolution will affect application of order-flow analysis in the future},

@article{Markowitz1952,
abstract = {This paper studies the flows of funds into and out of equity mutual funds. Con- sumers base their fund purchase decisions on prior performance information, but do so asymmetrically, investing disproportionately more in funds that performed very well the prior period. Search costs seem to be an important determinant of fund flows. High performance appears to be most salient for funds that exert higher marketing effort, as measured by higher fees. Flows are directly related to the size of the fund's complex as well as the current media attention received by the fund, which lower consumers' search costs},

@article{Mossin1966,
abstract = {This paper investigates the properties of a market for risky assets on the basis of a simple model of general equilibrium of exchange, where individual investors seek to maximize preference functions over expected yield and variance of yield on their portfolios. A theory of market risk premiums is outlined, and it is shown that general equilibrium implies the existence of a so-called "market line," relating per dollar expected yield and standard deviation of yield. The concept of price of risk is discussed in terms of the slope of this line.},

@article{Wooldridge2002,
abstract = {This graduate text provides an intuitive but rigorous treatment of contemporary methods used in microeconometric research. The book makes clear that applied microeconometrics is about the estimation of marginal and treatment effects, and that parametric estimation is simply a means to this end. It also clarifies the distinction between causality and statistical association.The book focuses specifically on cross section and panel data methods. Population assumptions are stated separately from sampling assumptions, leading to simple statements as well as to important insights. The unified approach to linear and nonlinear models and to cross section and panel data enables straightforward coverage of more advanced methods. The numerous end-of-chapter problems are an important component of the book. Some problems contain important points not fully described in the text, and others cover new ideas that can be analyzed using tools presented in the current and previous chapters. Several problems require the use of the data sets located at the author's website.},
